## Top football league players' performance stats

### Project Overview 

A project showcasing statistical insights into top football league players from five major leagues, with visualizations highlighting progressive carries, goal contributions, and competition performance."

### Data Source
Data Source: The raw data includes player metrics such as progressive carries, expected goals (xG), assists, and goal contributions, extracted and analyzed using SQL queries. The dataset is supplemented by Excel files containing aggregated league and player stats for enhanced analysis and visualization.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleanning [Download here](https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats)
- SQL Server - Data Analysis [Download here](https://1drv.ms/u/c/29f0e449ed577bcc/EdNOUJgUYplJgc6hKapmcKkBNF9YV3M93rd6TT7hahWsdQ?e=docL3X)

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

The raw football data underwent a thorough cleaning and preparation process to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key steps included:

1. Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns
2. Handling missing values by imputation or removal
3. Standardizing player names and team identifiers
4. Converting data types for numerical analysis (e.g., casting strings to decimals)
5. Creating calculated fields such as total progressive carries, expected goals (xG), and assists per 90 minutes
6. Aggregating data at player, club, and competition levels to facilitate analysis and visualization

This preprocessing was performed primarily using Excel and SQL queries to prepare a clean dataset suitable for insightful visualizations and reporting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase involved investigating the cleaned dataset to uncover key trends and insights into player and league performance. The main activities included:

- Identifying top performers across multiple dimensions including progressive carries, goal contributions, and xG overperformance.
- Analyzing competition-level metrics to compare average goals per 90 minutes and performance across the top 5 leagues.
- Visualizing relationships between variables, such as progressive carries versus combined goals and assists, using scatter plots and line charts.
- Segmenting players by age brackets and positions to explore productivity differences.
- Detecting any anomalies or outliers in the data to ensure robustness of the analysis.

The insights gained from EDA informed the design of targeted visualizations and helped highlight the most impactful performance factors.
